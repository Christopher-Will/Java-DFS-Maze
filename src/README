Program description:
Pressing the Generate button will generate a completely new maze. If the Show Generation box is checked then this generation
will be shown at a speed determined by the value of the speed slider. Otherwise the generation will happen all at once. If the
animation is shown then pressing pause will resume the generation. If you press Generate while paused then a new maze will be generated.
Pressing resume will simply resume the maze generation. A similar concept is used for solving the maze. It can only be solved after
it has been generated. And you can pause/resume the solving by using the same buttons. Changing the rows/columns will only take effect
when Generate is pressed. This is also true with the speed slider and the Show Generation boxes--you can't pause the generation, change
the settings, then resume the generation with the new settings. You have to make an entirely new maze. The DFS for solving this maze uses
the right-hand rule. So it first tries to visit a right neighbor, then a left, then bottom, and finally top.
